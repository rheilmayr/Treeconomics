# Review comment 3.3: 
#   the state-of-the-art way to analyze equation 1 and 2 from a statistical 
#   perspective would be to form a single hierarchical Bayesian model that 
#   would then allow model-based uncertainty quantification and inference 
#   without having to resort to the block bootstrap â€“which is notoriously 
#   sensitive to specification of blocks and in highly nonstationary (spatial 
#   and/or temporal) settings is quite suspect.  
# 
#
# Approach:
# - Run one integrated model?
